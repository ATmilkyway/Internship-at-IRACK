# Campus Network Overview üè¢üåê

A campus network is a local area network (LAN) that connects devices and users within a specific location, such as a university campus, office building, or shopping mall. It serves as the infrastructure for providing various services, including access to internal resources, internet connectivity, and communication between devices. Campus networks can be categorized based on size and complexity, with different architectural designs and principles.

## Typical Campus Network Architectures

Campus networks can be broadly classified into three categories:

1. Small: Suitable for a few dozen users in a single location. It has a simple architecture with basic network requirements.
2. Midsize: Supports hundreds to thousands of users. It adopts a modular design that allows for partitioning based on function.
3. Large: Covers multiple buildings and campuses across a city. It has a complex architecture with comprehensive functionality.

## Network Design Principles

Some common design principles for campus networks include:

- Hierarchical structure: The network is divided into layers (core, aggregation, access) to improve scalability and manageability.
- Modular design: The network can be easily expanded or modified by adding or removing modules.
- Security: Various security measures are implemented to protect the network from unauthorized access and threats.

## Key Components of a Campus Network

A campus network consists of several key components, including:

- Core layer: The backbone of the network, responsible for high-speed data transfer between other layers.
- Aggregation layer: Connects the access layer to the core layer and aggregates traffic from multiple access switches.
- Access layer: Provides direct connection to user devices such as computers and printers.
- Network devices: Switches, routers, firewalls, and access points (for wireless connectivity).

## Security Considerations

Security is an important aspect of campus networks, and some considerations include:

- Traffic control: Restricting access to internal resources and the internet for specific users or devices.
- DHCP snooping: Preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
- Access control lists (ACLs): Limiting access to network devices for management purposes.

## Network Management

Network management can be done through traditional methods such as Telnet and SSH for managing individual devices. Alternatively, a Network Management System (NMS) can be used for centralized monitoring and management of all network devices.
