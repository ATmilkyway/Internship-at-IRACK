# SDN (Software Defined Networking) üåêüîß

SDN is a network architecture that separates the control plane (which decides how traffic is routed) from the data plane (which handles actual data transmission) in network devices. This separation allows for centralized network management and brings several benefits:

- Centralized network management and simplification.
- Easier configuration and lower operational and maintenance costs.
- Automatic network optimization.
- Faster service deployment.
- Open network architecture for third-party applications.

# NFV (Network Function Virtualization) üñ•Ô∏èüîÅ

NFV virtualizes network functions, such as routing and firewalls, allowing them to run on industry-standard servers instead of dedicated hardware devices. NFV brings several benefits:

- Shortened service rollout time.
- Reduced network construction cost.
- Improved network operational and maintenance efficiency.
- Open ecosystem for virtualized network functions.

## Key Concepts

- SDN relies on the OpenFlow protocol for communication between the controller and switches. OpenFlow enables the controller to program the behavior of network switches.
- NFV utilizes virtualization technologies and cloud computing principles to abstract and virtualize network functions, enabling them to run on standardized servers.
- Both SDN and NFV aim to make networks more open, flexible, and efficient by separating network control from the underlying infrastructure and enabling the dynamic provisioning of network services.
