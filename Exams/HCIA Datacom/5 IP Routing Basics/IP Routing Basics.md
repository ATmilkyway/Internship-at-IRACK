📚 **IP Routing Basics** 🌐

🛣️ **Routes**
- Routes are the path information used to guide packet forwarding.
- A routing device is a network device that forwards packets to a destination subnet based on routes. The most common routing device is a router.
- A routing device maintains an IP routing table that stores routing information.

🔗 **Direct Routes**
A direct route is automatically generated by a device and points to a local directly-connected network.

🌍 **Default Routes**
Default routes are used only when packets to be forwarded do not match any routing entry in an IP routing table.
- In an IP routing table, a default route is the route to network 0.0.0.0 (with the mask 0.0.0.0), namely, 0.0.0.0/0.

🔄 **Route Recursion**
Route recursion is a process routers use to figure out how to send packets to destinations that aren't directly connected. It's like looking up an address in a nested address book.

🔀 **Floating Routes**
A floating route is a special type of static route used as a backup option in computer networks. It's like having a spare tire for your routing table.

💡 **CIDR**
CIDR is based on variable length subnet mask (VLSM). CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method used to allocate and manage IP addresses more efficiently.

📊 **Route Summarization**
Route summarization is an approach of summarizing routes with the same prefix into one summary route to minimize the IP routing table size and improve device resource usage.
