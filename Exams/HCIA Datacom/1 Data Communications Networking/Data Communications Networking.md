**Fat AP (standalone)**: Think Swiss Army Knife - does everything itself (wireless, security, management) but less scalable for big networks. 💪🔒🔧

**Fit AP (with WLC)**: Think Team Player - focuses on wireless access, relies on a central controller (WLC) for management & security. Great for large networks. 🤝🌐
