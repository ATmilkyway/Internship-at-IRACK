## Endpoint Monitoring 👀

Endpoint Monitoring involves continuously observing the activity of devices (laptops, desktops, phones, tablets) that connect to your network. It aims to identify suspicious behavior or potential threats by tracking applications, network traffic, file changes, and system events.

## BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) 💼📱

BYOD is a policy that allows employees to use their personal devices for work purposes. It enables flexibility and productivity but introduces security challenges. Endpoint monitoring plays a crucial role in monitoring and securing these devices.

## Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) 🛡️

Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) is a software solution that proactively protects endpoints from known threats like malware, viruses, and phishing attacks. EPP uses techniques like signature-based detection and application control to block threats.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) 🚨🔍

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a more advanced security solution that goes beyond basic prevention. EDR monitors endpoints for suspicious activities and analyzes them to identify and respond to potential threats, including zero-day attacks (previously unknown threats).

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 🔒🔓

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures in software and hardware products. Each CVE entry is assigned a unique identifier, known as a CVE ID, which allows organizations and security researchers to reference and track specific vulnerabilities.

The purpose of CVE is to provide a common language and framework for sharing information about vulnerabilities across different organizations, vendors, and security tools.
