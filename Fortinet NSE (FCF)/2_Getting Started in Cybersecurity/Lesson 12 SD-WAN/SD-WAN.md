## SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) üåêüñ•Ô∏è

SD-WAN revolutionizes how organizations manage geographically dispersed locations by leveraging software to intelligently control and optimize data traffic across various connection types.

### Core Concepts:

- Software-Defined: Unlike traditional hardware-based WANs, SD-WAN utilizes software for configuration and management, offering greater flexibility and programmability.

- Multi-Link Connectivity: SD-WAN can utilize various connections like:
  - MPLS (private leased lines)
  - Broadband internet
  - LTE (cellular data)
  - Other link types
  
  This creates a hybrid WAN environment, where multiple connections can be used simultaneously to improve performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
