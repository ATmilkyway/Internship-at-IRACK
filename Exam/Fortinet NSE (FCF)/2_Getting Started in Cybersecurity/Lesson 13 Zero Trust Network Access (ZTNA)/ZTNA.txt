## ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) 🔒🌐

ZTNA, which stands for Zero Trust Network Access, is a security approach that grants access to specific applications or resources based on strict verification, rather than granting access to an entire network once authenticated.

### Traditional Network Access vs. ZTNA:

#### Traditional 🗝️🔓:

In a traditional network access model, a user logs in once to the network (often through a VPN) and can then access any resource they have permission for within that network. This approach assumes trust once a user is inside the network perimeter.

#### ZTNA 🚫🔐:

ZTNA operates on a "never trust, always verify" principle. Even authorized users need to be continuously verified before being granted access to specific applications or resources. ZTNA focuses on authenticating and validating users, devices, and the security posture of the environment before granting access, regardless of whether the user is inside or outside the network perimeter.
