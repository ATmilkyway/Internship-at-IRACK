## SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) 🔒☁️

SASE, which stands for Secure Access Service Edge, is a cloud-based security framework that combines networking and security functionalities to provide secure access to applications and data for users regardless of their location. It essentially acts as a single point of control for both network connectivity and security.

### Traditional vs. SASE Approach:

#### Traditional 🔄🔒:

Organizations often rely on separate solutions for network connectivity (e.g., MPLS, SD-WAN) and security (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems). Managing these disparate solutions can be complex and lead to security gaps.

#### SASE ☁️🔒:

SASE offers a unified approach by integrating networking and security features into a single cloud-based service. This simplifies management and potentially improves the overall security posture. SASE combines multiple security capabilities, such as secure web gateways, firewall-as-a-service, data loss prevention (DLP), zero trust network access (ZTNA), and more, into a comprehensive cloud-native solution.

### Core Capabilities of SASE:

1. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): Provides secure access to applications and resources based on strict identity verification and continuous authentication, following the "never trust, always verify" principle.

2. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Offers advanced firewall capabilities, including intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and application-aware filtering, to protect the network against evolving threats.

3. Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Helps prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data by monitoring and controlling data transfers, both within the network and to external destinations.

SASE brings together these core capabilities and other security functions in a unified and scalable manner.
