# Network Access Control (NAC) 🔒🔑

Network Access Control (NAC) is a method used to secure and manage access to a network by enforcing policies and controlling the devices and users that can connect to it. NAC ensures that only authorized and compliant devices and users can gain access to the network, while preventing unauthorized access and potential security threats.

NAC typically involves the following components and functionalities:

1. Authentication ✅: NAC requires users and devices to authenticate themselves before accessing the network. This authentication can be done through various methods, such as username/password credentials, digital certificates, or multifactor authentication.

2. Authorization 🚦: Once authenticated, NAC verifies whether the authenticated user or device has the necessary privileges and permissions to access the network resources. This step ensures that only authorized users and devices can proceed further.

3. Endpoint Security Assessment 🛡️: NAC evaluates the security posture and compliance of the connecting devices. It checks for factors such as up-to-date antivirus software, operating system patches, and adherence to security policies. Non-compliant devices may be denied network access or put into a restricted network segment until they meet the required security standards.

4. Network Segmentation 🌐: NAC can enforce network segmentation, dividing the network into logical segments or VLANs. This helps in isolating different types of users or devices and restricting their access based on their roles or security requirements. Segmentation enhances network security by containing potential threats and limiting lateral movement within the network.

5. Continuous Monitoring 📡: NAC continuously monitors the network for any unauthorized or suspicious activities. It can detect anomalies, such as changes in device behavior or unusual traffic patterns, and respond accordingly, such as blocking or quarantining the suspicious device.

6. Policy Enforcement ⚖️: NAC enforces network access policies based on predefined rules and conditions. These policies can specify which users or devices are allowed or denied access, what resources they can access, and the level of access privileges granted.

NAC plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of a network infrastructure by ensuring that only authorized and compliant entities can connect to the network and access its resources.
