## Threat Landscape and Types of Bad Actors

### Threat Landscape

The threat landscape refers to the entire scope of potential and recognized cybersecurity threats affecting user groups, organizations, specific industries, or a particular time. It encompasses all known and possible threats to computer networks.

### Threat Actors

A cybersecurity threat actor is an individual, group, organization, or entity engaged in activities designed to compromise computer systems, networks, data, or information. They can have various motivations, skills, and resources and employ several tactics, techniques, and procedures to achieve their objectives.

### Types of Bad Actors

1. **The Explorer:** The explorer is motivated by notoriety and is the least nefarious of all bad actor types. They may use tactics like phishing to achieve their goals.

   ![Phishing Variants](./Images/phishing_variants.jpg)

   - Phishing: The most general term, it attempts to trick victims into revealing personal information, clicking malicious links, or downloading malware.
   - Spear Phishing: Targets a specific person or organization.
   - Whaling: Targets high-level personnel such as CEOs, COOs, and CTOs.
   - Vishing: Fraudulent phone calls to induce victims to reveal personal information.
   - Smishing: Fraudulent text messages meant to trick victims into revealing data.

2. **The Hacktivist:** Motivated by ideology or social causes, hacktivists act collectively against their perceived enemies. They may build botnets for coordination and execute attacks.

3. **The Cyberterrorists:** Cyberterrorists aim to intimidate and destabilize a society by disrupting computer or communication networks. They target critical infrastructure like power grids, nuclear plants, etc.

4. **The Cybercriminal:** Motivated by financial gain, cybercriminals engage in activities like theft, fraud, or ransomware attacks.

5. **The Cyberwarrior:** Backed by nation-states, cyberwarriors are motivated by national interests and have significant resources at their disposal.

### Attack Vector and Main Cybersecurity Threats

The attack vector is the way attackers enter a network or system. It comprises three components: vulnerability, exploit, and payload.

![Main Cybersecurity Threats](./Images/main_cybersecurity_threats.jpg)

Some main cybersecurity threats include malware, social engineering, phishing, ransomware, DDoS attacks, and insider threats.

### Threat Intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK

Threat intelligence involves gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information about potential or current cyber threats. Organizations can use various sources, including internal, external, government, private, and open-source intelligence.

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally recognized framework that provides a comprehensive knowledge base of adversarial tactics and techniques used by cyber threat actors during various stages of a cyber attack.

### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and Attack Framework

An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) refers to a prolonged and targeted cyber attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period.

The Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK are two foundational frameworks in cybersecurity that help understand and defend against cyberattacks.

### Qualities of Threat Intelligence

For information to qualify as threat intelligence, it should possess the following three qualities:

- Relevance: It should be applicable and specific to the organization's environment and potential threats.
- Context: It should provide a deeper understanding of the threat landscape, including tactics used by threat actors.
- Actionability: It should offer practical guidance or recommendations to mitigate or respond to the identified threats.
